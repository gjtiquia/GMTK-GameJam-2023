It's a boss fight, but the roles are reversed. You are the boss, and the hero is here to fight you.

Will you give the player a good time? Or will you just have fun and bully the hero?

Inspired by the fact that enemy AI is desgined to favour players and give them a good "player satisfaction". Game balance is crucial for players to enjoy any game. Also a great reminder that enemies in game can be really OP, it's just that they restrain themselves from one-shotting you so that you can have fun :)

Clicking the gun icon before attacking will signal the hero to anticipate your attack and attempt to dodge it. If the hero is able to dodge the attack, player satisfaction will go up. The opposite is true.  Spam the attack button without any anticipation and the player satisfaction will keep dropping. The player won't have fun but I'm sure you will ;)
